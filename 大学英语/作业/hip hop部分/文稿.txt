Hip Hop Music

hi,everybody!
Excuse me for introducing hip hop music to all of you

hip-hop music is  a cultrue borned in 1960s,which was mainly developed by black people living in American and Europe

And it is performed by the way of DJ/B-boying/Graffiti/B-box/Rap

yeah, rap is one element of it

Now,let's listen to a song

Has everyone known Eminem and Redfoo?
I'm a big fan of them.
If you have no impression of their names,
You must have heard of the songs like<rap god> , <Love The Way you lie> and<New thang>.

If you still don't know what hip-hop music is……ok,let's talk about other singers

Many boys and girls like KnowKnow whose English name is 马思维，
He has a cognizable voice and brilliant skill in singing rap song
And Kris Wu,whose English name is 吴亦凡
He takes good command of freestyle

What's more ,there are many TV programs regarding hip-hop music
Like that#放中国新说唱
Like that#放说唱新世代
And like that#中国有嘻哈


Different areas have their own features of hip-hop,
Hip hop of Atlantic region features in unique and smooth way of singing.
In the SouthAmerican,people sing with a strong regional accent.

hip hop borned in a small community and spread worldwide just like sparks of fire in the grass.
Nowadays,more and more people try to understand,digest and spread hip-hop cultrue.
It shows that the world is developing in a diversified way.
No far away,we can find the world  more muticultural and more hip-hop。
