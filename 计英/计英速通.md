| Many data formats use more than one 8-bit byte to represent a value, whether it is an integer, floating point number, or character string. |
| 许多数据格式使用多个字节（一个字节8位）来表示一个数据，而不管此数值是整型数、浮点数还是字符串。 |
| Most CPUs assign addresses to 8-bit memory locations, so these values must be stored in more than one location. It is necessary for every CPU to define the order it expects for the data in these locations. |
| 由于大多数CPU给8位的存储器单元分配地址，因此这些值必须存储在多个单元中，每个CPU必须定义数据在这些单元中的顺序。 |
| There are programs which can convert data files from one format to the other |
| 有程序可以将两种数据文件进行格式转换                         |
| One other issue of concern for multibyte words is **alignment**. |
| 多字节的另一个值得关注的问题是对齐问题。现代微处理器在某一时刻可以读出多个字节。 |
| Alignment simply means storing multibyte values in locations such that they begin at a location that also begins a multibyte read block. |
| 对齐简单地说就使存储多字节值的起始单元刚好是某个多字节读取模块的开始单元 |
| In this example, this means beginning multibyte values at memory locations that have addresses evenly divisible by four, thus guaranteeing that a four-byte value can be accessed by a single read operation. |
| 在这个例子中，意味着多字节值开始存储的单元的地址要能被4整除，这样就保证该4字节值可在单一的一个读操作中存取到。 |
| The key to this design is the enable logic. Just as every memory location has a unique address, each I/O device also has a unique address |
| 这一设计的关键在于使能逻辑。正如每一个存储单元都有一个惟一的地址一样，每一个I/O设备也有一个惟一的地址。 |



##### QA

In computers, a **(1)pipeline** is the continuous and somewhat overlapped movement of **(2)instructions** to the processor or in the arithmetic steps taken by the processor to perform an instruction. Pipelining is the use of a pipeline. 

Without a pipeline, a computer processor gets the first instruction from memory, performs the **(3)operation** it calls for, and then goes to get the next instruction from memory, and **(4)so forth**. While **(5)fetching** the instruction, the **(6)arithmetic** part of the processor is **(7)idle**. It must wait until it gets the next instruction.

With pipelining, the computer **(8)architecture** allows the next instructions to be fetched while the processor is performing arithmetic operations, holding them in a **(9)buffer** close to the processor until each instruction operation can be performed. The staging of instruction fetching is continuous. The result is an **(10)increase** in the number of instructions that can be performed during a given time period.



**ROM和RAM芯片的内部组成是相似的。为了说明一个最简单的组成——线性组成，我们来考虑一个8´2的ROM芯片。**

The internal organizations of ROM and RAM chips are similar. To illustrate the simplest organization, a linear organization, consider an 8´2 ROM chip.

**为了简化，编程器件没有画出来。这个芯片有三个地址输入端和两个数据输出端，以及16位的内部存储元件，它排列成8个单元，每个单元2位。**

For simplicity, programming components are not shown. This chip has three address inputs and two data outputs, and 16 bits of internal storage arranged as eight 2-bit locations.

**对齐简单地说就使存储多字节值的起始单元刚好是某个多字节读取模块的开始单元。在这个例子中，意味着多字节值开始存储的单元的地址要能被4整除，这样就保证该4字节值可在单一的一个读操作中存取到。**

Alignment simply means storing multibyte values in locations such that they begin at a location that also begins a multibyte read block.

In this example, this means beginning multibyte values at memory locations that have addresses evenly divisible by four, thus guaranteeing that a four-byte value can be accessed by a single read operation.

##### QA

Multiply linked list**（多重链表）**
While doubly linked lists can be seen as special cases of multiply linked list, the fact that the two orders are opposite to each other leads to simpler and more efficient algorithms, so they are usually treated as a separate case.

**虽然双向链表可以被看作是多重链表的特殊情况，但是拥有两种彼此相反次序的链表能得到更简单和更有效的算法，所以它们通常被视为单独的情况。**

Reusability 
Data structures are reusable because they tend to be modular and context-free**.** 
They are modular because each has a prescribed interface through which access to data stored in the data structure is restricted**.** 
That is, we access the data using only those operations the interface defines. 

**复用性
因为数据结构趋向于模块化并和环境无关,所以数据结构是可以复用的。因为每种结构有一个预定的接口,通过该接口限制访问存储在数据结构中的数据，所以它们是模块化的。也就是说,我们只能使用接口定义的那些操作来访问数据。**

2.The CPU keeps the address of the next instruction to be fetched in **program counter**.

3.The instruction cycle is also called the **fetch-decode-and-execute** cycle.

4.Either both chips or neither chip **is** active at any given time.

6.Virtual memory uses **a hard disk** as a part of the computer's memory



**1. What are big endian and little endian.** 

In big endian format, the most significant byte of a value is stored in location X, the following byte in location X+l, and so on. 

In little endian, the order is reversed. The least significant byte is stored in location X, the next byte in location X+1, and so on.

**2. What does “word” mean in computer architecture.**

A word in computer architecture is a fixed-sized piece of data handled as a unit by the instruction set or the hardware of the processor. 



A buffer is a data area shared by **(1)hardware** devices or program processes that **(2)operate** at different speeds or with different sets of priorities. The buffer allows each **(3)device** or process to operate without being held up by the **(4)other**. 

In order for a buffer to be **(5)effective**, the size of the buffer and the algorithms for **(6)moving** data into and out of the buffer need to be **(7)considered** by the buffer **(8)designer**. Like a cache, a buffer is a 'midpoint holding place' but **(9)exists** not so much to accelerate the **(10)speed** of an activity as to support the coordination of separate activities.



A binary tree is a method of placing and locating files (called records or keys) in a  **(1)database** , especially when all the data is known to be in   **(2) random**  access memory (RAM). The algorithm finds data by repeatedly dividing the number of ultimately accessible  **(3)records**  in half until only one remains.

In a tree, records are stored in locations called  **(4)leaves** . This name derives from the fact that records always exists at   **(5)end** points; there is nothing  **(6)beyond**   them. Branch points are called  **(7)nodes** . The order of a tree is the number of branches (called children) per node. In a binary tree, there are always  **(8)two** children per node, so the order is 2. The number of leaves in a binary tree is always a  **(9)power** of 2. The number of access operations required to reach the desired record is called the   **(10)depth** of the tree.

| In the partitioned resource allocation approach, the OS decides on the resources to be allocated to a program based on the number of resources and the number of programs in the system. |
| 在资源分区分配方法中，操作系统依据系统中的资源数目和程序数目决定如何进行资源分配。 |
| The shorter term preemption is used for preemption of the CPU, and the full term resource preemption is used for preemption of other resources. |
| 我们称抢占CPU为抢占，而称抢占其他资源为资源抢占。            |
| Both the partitioning and the pool-based allocation approaches can be used to manage the memory resource. |
| 资源分区和基于资源池的分配方式都适用于存储器资源管理。       |
| In a concurrent program, different parts of the program can execute concurrently. |
| 而在并发程序中，程序的不同部分可被同时执行。                 |

**Two popular strategies for resource allocation are:**

• **Partitioning of resources**

• **Allocation from a pool**

资源分配通常采取以下两种策略：资源分区/从资源池中分配。



**Resource preemption** /资源抢占

**There are different ways in which resource can be shared by a set of programs. Some of these are:**

•**Sequential sharing**

•**Concurrent sharing**

资源被一系列程序分享可以有多种不同的方式，如:串行共享,并行共享



##### QA

1. Policies are usually architecture **independent**, while mechanisms are often architecture **dependent/specific.** 

2. The porting effort of an operating system is determined by **the size of the OS kernel**.

3. Resource control actions of the module can be classified into

​	(a). **Policies** governing the use of resources.

​	(b). **Mechanisms** to implement the policy.

4. Thus, in either case the entry to the kernel is through the interrupt processing mechanism. For this reason, the OS kernel is often said to be **interrupt-driven**.



An operating system (sometime abbreviated as “OS”) is the program that, after being initially  **(1)loaded**  into the computer by a  **(2)boot(引导)**  program, manages all the other programs in a computer. The other programs are called  **(3)applications**  or application programs. The application programs make  **(4)use**  of the operating system by making  **(5)requests**  for services through a  **(6)defined**  application program interface (API). In addition, users can  **(7)interact**  directly with the operating system  **(8)through**  a user interface such as a  **(9)command**  language or a  **(10)graphical**  user interface (GUI).



##### QA

1.OS functions can be divided into **resource allocation and related functions, and user interface functions** .

2.Resources can be divided into **system provided resources, and user-created resources** .

3.Two types of strategies for resource allocation are partitioning of resources **(static allocation)** , and allocation from a pool **(dynamic allocation)** .

4.There are two ways of sharing: **sequential sharing, and concurrent sharing** .

5.What is resource preemption?

When a resource is sequentially shareable, the system can de-allocate a resource when the program makes an explicit request for de-allocation. 

Alternatively, **it can de-allocate a resource by force**. This is called resource preemption, that is, **forceful de-allocation of a resource**.

A compiler translates the code into **an intermediary form** . This step is called **compiling** , and produces **an object file** . The compiler then invokes **a linker** , which turns the object file into **an executable program**.



the C’s program building process involves four stages and utilizes different ‘tools’ such as a **preprocessor** , **compiling** , **assembler** , and **linker** .



(1)( **load**): To transfer (data) from a storage device into a computer’s memory.

(2)(**compile**): To translate (a program) into machine language.

(3)(**value**): An assigned or calculated numerical quantity.

(4)(**instruction**): A machine code telling a computer to perform a particular operation.

(5) (**interpret**): To translate a statement or instruction into executable from and then execute it.

(6) (**alphabet**): The letters of a language, arranged in the order fixed by custom.

(7) (**assembler**): A program operating on symbolic input data to produce the equivalent executable machine code.

(8) (**utility**): A program designed to perform a particular function; the term usually refers to software that solve narrowly focused problems or those related to computer system management. 

(9) (**communication**): The technology employed in transmitting message.

(10) (**programmer**): One who writes computer programs.



java is A programming language expressly designed for use in the distributed  **(1)environment**  of the Internet. IT was designed to have the "look and feel“ of the C++ language, but it's simpler to use than C++ and  **(2)enforces**  an object oriented programming model. Java can be used to create complete applications that may run on a  **(3)single**  computer or be distributed among **(4)servers** and clients in a network. It can also be used to build a small application module or **(5)applet** for use as part of a Web page. Applets make it possible for a web page user to **(6)interact** with the page. 

The Java virtual machine includes an optional just-in-time **(7)compiler** that dynamically compiles bytecode into **(8)executable**  code as an alternative to interpreting one bytecode instruction at a time. In many case, the **(9)dynamic**  JIT compilation is faster then the virtual machine **(10)interpretation** .

The transceiver transmits and **(2)receives** in a previously unused **(3)frequency** band of 2.45 GHz that is available **(4)globally** (with some variation of bandwidth in different countries), In addition to data, up to three **(5)voice** channels are available. Each device has a **(6)unique** 48-bit address from the IEEE 802 standard. Connections can be point-to-point or **(7)multipoint**.
The maximum range is 10 meters. Data can be **(8)exchanged** at a rate of 1 megabit per second (up to 2 Mbps in the second generation of the technology). A frequency hop **(9)scheme** allows devices to communicate even in areas with a great deal of electromagnetic interference. Built-in encryption and **(10)verification** is provided.



**For a family of four, for example, it is more convenient as well as cheaper to sit comfortably at home, with almost unlimited entertainment available, than to go out in search of amusement elsewhere.**

譬如, 对于一个四口之家来说, 舒舒服服地在家中看电视, 就能看到几乎数不清的娱乐节目, 这比到外面别的地方去消遣又便宜又方便。



#### 顺序法

**Even when we turn off the beside lamp and are fast asleep, electricity is working for us, driving our refrigerators, heating our water, or keeping our rooms air-conditioned.**

即使在我们关掉了床头灯深深地进入梦乡时**,** 电仍在为我们工作**:** 帮我们开动电冰箱**,** 把水加热**,** 或使室内空调机继续运转。

#### 逆序法

**For our purposes we will say e-commerce begins in 1995, following the appearance of the first banner advertisements placed by ATT, Volvo, Sprint and others on Hotwired.com in late October 1994, and the first sales of banner ad space by Netscape and Infoseek in early 1995.**

伴随着ATT、Volvo、Sprint等公司所做的第一例横幅广告于1994年10月下旬出现在Hotwired.com上，和1995年初Netscape与Infoseek领先出售横幅广告空间，我们会说电子商务是从1995年开始的。

#### 分句法

**The number of the young people in the United States who can't read is incredible about one in four.**

大约有1/4的美国青年人没有阅读能力, 这简直令人难以置信。

#### 综合法

**Napster.com, which was established to aid Internet users in finding and sharing online music files known as MP3 files, is perhaps the most well-known example of peer-to-peer e-commerce, although purists note that Napster is only partially peer-to-peer because it relies on a central database to show which users are sharing music files.**

Napster.com建立的目标是帮助因特网用户发现并分享在线音乐文件，即人所共知的MP3文件。尽管纯化论者强调：因为它依赖中央数据库来显示哪一位用户正在分享音乐文件，所以Napster仅仅是部分对等。但Napster或许是对等电子商务最著名的实例。

### 简答题

What is Von Neumann architecture?

The von Neumann architecture,which is also known as the Von Neumann model and Princeton architecture.This describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with parts consisting of:(1)a processing unit containing an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers;(2)a control unit containing an instruction register and program counter.(3)a memory to store both data and instructions.(4)external mass storage.(5)and input and output mechanisms.



What is resource preemption?

When a resource is sequentiallu sharable,the system can de-allocate a resource when the program makes an explicit request for de-allocation.Alternatively,it can de-allocate a resource by force.This is called resource preemption,that is ,forceful de-allocation of a resource.



How to generate the radix-1 and radix complements?

To form the radix-1 complement,each digit of the number is substracted from the radix-1.

To form the radix complement,first find the radix-1 complement,and then add a one to the result.



When is black box testing?

Black-box testing treats the software as a "black box",examining functionality without any knowledge of internal implementation,without seeing the source code.The testers are only aware of what the software is supposed to do,not how it does it.



#### Chapter 2

**1. What are big endian and little endian.** 

In big endian format, the most significant byte of a value is stored in location X, the following byte in location X+l, and so on. 

In little endian, the order is reversed. The least significant byte is stored in location X, the next byte in location X+1, and so on.

**2. What does “word” mean in computer architecture.**

A word in computer architecture is a fixed-sized piece of data handled as a unit by the instruction set or the hardware of the processor. 



#### Chapter 3

**Whole Number** **Conversion from Decimal.** 

**To convert a decimal whole number to another number system, divide by the radix and save the** **remainders** **as** **significant digits** **of the result. An** **algorithm** **for this conversion as is follows:**

 **1.** **Divide** **the decimal number by the radix (number base).**

 **2. Save the** **remainder** **(first remainder is the** **least significant digit****),**

 **3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the** **quotient** **is zero.**



#### Chatper 5

When a resource is **sequentially shareable**, the system can de-allocate a resource when the program makes an **explicit request for de-allocation**. 
Alternatively, it can de-allocate a resource by force. 
This is called **resource preemption**, that is, forceful de-allocation of a resource.



The shorter term **preemption** is used for preemption of the CPU, and the full term **resource preemption** is used for preemption of other resources.



**CPU sharing**
The CPU can be shared in a **sequential manner** only. 
Hence only one program can execute at any time. Other programs in the system have to wait their turn. 
It is often important to provide fair service to all programs in the system. 
Hence preemption is used to free the CPU so that it can be given to another program. 
Deciding which program should be given the CPU and for how long is a critical function. This function is called **CPU Scheduling**, or simply scheduling**.** 
Partitioning is a bad approach for CPU Sharing, **allocation from a pool** is the obvious approach to use.

**Memory sharing**
Like the CPU, the memory also **cannot be shared concurrently**. 
However, unlike the CPU, its availability can be increased by treating different parts of memory as different resources**.** 
Both the partitioning and **the pool-based allocation approaches** can be used to manage the memory resource.

Memory preemption can also be used to increase the availability of memory to programs. 
Special terms are used for different memory preemption techniques, hence the term “**memory preemption**” is rarely used in our discussions. 



Different operating systems **address these issues** in different manner, however most operating systems contain components which have similar functionalities. 
For example, all operating systems contain components for functions of **memory management, process management and protection of users** from one another.  //存储器管理、进程管理和用户保护



Jobs, programs and processes
The **primary function** of an OS is to organize the execution of user computations in a computer system. 
A suitable characterization of user computations is therefore fundamental to its design. 
Three characterizations of user computations have been used to date--**jobs, programs and processes**. 



Many well-known OS kernels include functionalities, for example, **process scheduling, device drivers, core file system services and certain memory management functions**.//过度调度、设备驱动系统、核心文件系统服务以及一些存储器管理功能。



**OS microkernel**

Some well-known microkernels include the QNX kernel which is only 8K bytes in size and includes **process scheduling, interrupt handling, interprocess communication and core network services**.//过程调度，中断处理，过程间通信及核心网络服务
